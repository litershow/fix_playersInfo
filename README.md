# PlayersInfo

Metamod:Source plugin for CS2 that dumps the server state and connected players as a single JSON line. Built for web dashboards, admin panels, and anything that needs to pull live player info over RCON or a shared file.

## Features

- **Single-line JSON** output via three console commands
- **Full server dump** (`mm_getinfo`), **single player** (`mm_getinfo_slot <N>`), **atomic file write** (`mm_getinfo_file <path>`)
- **Prime status** detection via `UserHasLicenseForApp` with proper Steam API init
- **UTF-8 safe** — emoji, Cyrillic, any nickname passes through, invalid bytes stripped
- **RCON multi-packet** aware — 60-player JSON (~12 KB) delivered in full without truncation
- **No MySQL, no HTTP client, no external services** — just C++ and the CS2 SDK

## Quick start

```
# from server console or RCON
mm_getinfo                          # full JSON to console/RCON reply
mm_getinfo_slot 2                   # one player's JSON
mm_getinfo_file /var/www/stats.json # atomic file write
```

Example response (`mm_getinfo`):

```json
{
  "time": 1776504678,
  "current_map": "de_dust2",
  "score_ct": 0,
  "score_t": 0,
  "player_count": 1,
  "players": [{

## Web integration

Consume the JSON from PHP, Node, Python, or Go over RCON — or serve the file as static via nginx. Full recipes with working code in [docs/web-integration.md](docs/web-integration.md).

Quick RCON example (Node):
```js
import RCON from 'rcon-srcds';
const server = new RCON({ host: '1.2.3.4', port: 27015 });
await server.authenticate('rcon_pw');
const data = JSON.parse((await server.execute('mm_getinfo')).trim());
```
